What You Shouldn't Do
---------------------

I used to waste much time with activies that I didn't plan. I couldn't attend the meetings and gatherings with my family and friends. Over time I saw If I continue it, I could lose my job.
It's common to have meetings in the company that I work, but I always lost because I was the last to know it.
Well, I was tired to hear complaints about it. So I tried to follow some methodologies, but after a while I stopped to follow these methodologies because It was hard, boring, after a while hearing the same complaints, trying and failing, I received an invitation on the Facebook to join a group called Saving Time, Buying Time, at first moment I think: It won't work, anyway I solved to try again, because my coworkers said that I should find someone to help me, then I wrote a post explaining my situation, telling If I don't change my behavior I could be fired and how was my period trying to follow the methodologies to organize my activities, and then the magic happened, a lot of people said what was the reason that I didn't achieve my goals, and how I should follow the methodologies to gain speed and to change my habits.
Well, I guess this time It will work. Now I must to go. Bye.
