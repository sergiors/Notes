Hi, Mr. Wilson.

My name is Sérgio, I'm a developer, currently I'm living in Florianópolis a beautiful place in Brazil's south.
I'm looking for a new opportunity. I think I'm the person you're looking for.

Currently I'm working on an integration for INBEP that turn a bunch of services in a centralized API, I'm using Python as main language and Amazon Services, like DynamoDB, EC2 and ECS to work with Docker.

Previously I worked a lot with Silex, Doctrine, Symfony ecosystem and PostgreSQL as database, all the tools were written to work on PHP.

I would like to continue working with Python, however, I can handle with PHP or JavaScript.

As I said, I think I'm the person you're looking for. I'm a person that like to learn, like to share knowledge and very proactive. As You said in the ad, you need a person to bring knowledge and boost the team.

I really like to learn and share, I think that is a good opportunity to show it.

You can talk to me by mobile or whatsapp:

Best,
Sérgio
