Moods and feelings
------------------

Glad cheerful - Opposite of **sad**

You can say **morose** or **desolate** instead _very sad_.
Another way to express our sadness is by using the word **devastated**.  
This word is a little more formal.

You can say **elated**, **exultant** or **thrilled** instead _very happy_.

### Sad
> - A man dressed black and white was sitting **moresely** in front of him.
> - After Eve left Jonny, has was **devastated** for months.


### Happy
> - Jeremy's wife is **elated** because the football league is finally over.
> - The president waved to the **exultant** crowds.
> - When Jason got promoted last year he was thrilled with the good news.


If you're **bored**, it means you're not interested in the sintuaion you're in.  
The opposite of boring is being **entertained**

> - I'm so bored at home since the internet doesn't work
> - Peter is quite entertained with the new video game.

You may be **angry** at something or someone, If you're very angry, it means you're **furious** or **mad**. But, you might just be **upset** or **annoyed** about something.
